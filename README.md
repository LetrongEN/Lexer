# Lexer
A program skeleton for compilers for Compilers at CSUF.

Project members: Juan Linares and Ethan Letrong

Purpose: Project is supposed to read in a text file and sort it into data that can be used in a lexer or compiler.

File will read every line and store it in a string where it will be sorted and seperated into individual data types in a Vector. 

The program will also read through each element of the vector and display what it's attribute is.
